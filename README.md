# DSGAnalyze

**This is currently a work in progress**

This is a web app where it will be analyzing the sale results from records exported from the Shopify platform. We are mainly looking for seeing how many products were sold at select discounts along with totals for profit, cost and retail value. 

It uses Papaparse to analyze CSV data.
